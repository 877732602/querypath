Date:   Fri Jul 24 18:23:45 2009 -0500

Date:   Thu Jul 9 20:49:50 2009 -0500

    Added filter to top(), fixed isXMLish()
    
    The top() function now takes a selector. The isXMLish() function

    been updated, including a new larger XML file test to check for
    memory exhuastion on moderately sized files.

Author: M Butcher <matt@aleph-null.tv>

Date:   Tue Jul 7 12:43:51 2009 -0500

    Fixed ~ operator.
    
    The ~ operator was too greedy. Now it is restricted according to
    the latest draft of the CSS 3 Selector specification. Also added
    the appropriate unit tests.

Author: M Butcher <matt@aleph-null.tv>

    Added new method hasAttr().
    
    The hasAttr() method allows you to easily test whether an attr
    exists. Since it uses low-level DOM, it is faster than higher-
    level implementations. Unit tests added, too, of course.

    Continuing build script reworking.
    
    Builds are now generating tar archives correctly. Both minimal and
    full builds are working. Vesrion now contains a timestamp for
    default dev builds. Some of the old scripts have been added, as
    have the rudiments of a PEAR package.

    writing to STDOUT. New unit tests for each of these. New unit test

Date:   Fri Jun 26 08:35:44 2009 -0500

    Added file writing to writeXML.
    
    writeXML() now takes an optional file argument. When given, the

commit 4a9304f110556a130b89036fbba8a900f501cba3
Author: M Butcher <matt@aleph-null.tv>
Date:   Thu Jun 25 00:24:01 2009 -0500

    Fixed bug in elementNS() css event handler.
    
    Just as with the anyElementInNS issue, this event handler also did
    not check the base node for matching. This too may need rolling
    back (see previous commit).

commit bdf99fe0680a74966927df5aa750f1b1521d3577
Author: M Butcher <matt@aleph-null.tv>
Date:   Thu Jun 25 00:12:13 2009 -0500

    Fixed bug in anyElementInNS. Added tests.
    
    Working through coverage tests. Fixed obscure bug in
    anyElementInNS() that prevented it from selecting the base node of
    a search. There is the possibility that this might need to be
    rolled back, as the spec is not specific about whether the filter
    ns|* should match the base node, or only its children. Currently
    it matches the base node and descendants.

    Fixed bug in replaceAll(). More unit tests.

    Improved error handling for XML fragment inserts.
    
    append(), after(), before(), prepend() and so on use
    prepareInsert() to handle importing fragments of XML. This has
    now been modified to throw exceptions when parser errors are
    generated by libxml.

    Refactored tests, added better error handling.

    Improved error handling.
    
    Failed stream loading now throws an exception instead of logging
    an error. This should make exception handling much easier.

    Migrating docs to new QueryPath file.

    New QueryPathIterator makes use of SplObjectStorage. Also added
    some tests for multiline text data with empty text nodes.

    Fixed all unit tests, removed old class.
    
    The uniqueness checking class is now completely expunged from
    QueryPath, as SplObjectStorage has made it obsolete.

    including a CSS reference (rough draft).

    All but one unit test now passing.
    
    The CSS Event Handler passes almost all unit tests, now, including
    some that QP 1.2 did not correctly pass. Also adjusted some of the
    behavior to comply with the current CSS 3 selector specification.
    
    This does make QP behave differently than jQuery 1.2. Have not
    tested it against jQ 1.3.
